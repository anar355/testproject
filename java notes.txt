GENERAL NOTES
Java notes

Java has 2 types:
Primitives
Reference types = class, interface, annotation, enum, record, array

Record= separate reference type that creates the class with standard things such as constructor, getter, setter, equals(), toString() and hashcode() methods generated automatically
Example: 	public record MyStudent (int id, String name) {
}
